This dataset is humongous (>5E06 rows) and was found within Google Cloud Bigquery.
Just search openaq and click on "global_air_quality" if you have trouble finding it.
The original raw data file was too big, so, this is table is the result of a groupby function. Its a list of all of the raw data for countries between the months of april 2022 and may 2022.
It is Raw Data in the sense of still having null values.
The original data set has about 5E06 rows of data. This data can be used for machine learning model training since there are many individual cities.
Potential Strong Point: This dataset has pollution data for THOUSANDS of US cities, we can use this to train a strong ML model for predicting life expectancy per US city potentially.
