## Selected topic and reasoning for selection 

How Energy, Pollution, and Socioeconomic Factors Affect Health Metrics

## Description of the data source 

For answering the question as it relates the united states, a few government databases have been used, such as the EPA, the CDC and the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission

As it relates to our global question, we have used Google Cloud BigQuery for our global air quality and The World Bank for GDP statistics

## Questions the group originally aimed to answer with the data

* Does the presence of a nuclear power plant within a county increase the risks of cancer(s) (e.g. thyroid) for the residents of that county?
* Does the presence of a pollution-emitting power plant in a county and the various air quality indices (NOx, SOx, particulate matter, etc) correlate to rates of asthma, lung disease, or lung cancer?
* Can you predict a countryâ€™s life expectancy with various readily available factors such as GDP per capita, healthcare spending per capita, energy sources, pollution levels, poverty levels, etc?
