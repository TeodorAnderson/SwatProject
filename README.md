## Selected Topic and Reasoning for Selection 
Probing the Links Between Energy Sources, Pollution, and Socioeconomic Factors with Various Health Metrics

Nuclear energy is often feared by the public because of the potential health hazards of radiation. But are these fears warranted? Or are normal fossil fuel power plants more dangerous for our health? We plan to compare the two to see which one has a stronger correlation to a variety of diseases and cancers.

On a global scale, the required metrics are often not collected at a granular-enough scale to do a similar study, so instead we are going to see if we can develop a model that takes in commonly available worldwide data about countries and outputs the country's life expectancy.

## Questions the Group Originally Aimed to Answer with the Data
- Does the proximity of a nuclear power plant to a county in the United States increase the risks of cancer (e.g. thyroid) for the residents of that county?
- Do (1) the proximity of a pollution-emitting fossil fuel power plant to a county and (2) pollutant emissions (NOx, SOx, particulate matter, etc) correlate to rates of lung diseases, cardiovascular diseases, or cancers?
- Can you predict a countryâ€™s life expectancy with various readily available factors such as GDP per capita, healthcare spending per capita, energy sources, pollution levels, poverty levels, rates of smoking, obesity rates, etc?

## Description of the Data Sources
- Every county in the US and the coordinates of its geographic midpoint
- Every nuclear power plant currently operating in the US, their geographic coordinates, and their nameplate generation capacity
- Every fossil fuel (oil, gas, coal, biomass, other) power plant currently operating in the US, their geographic coordinates, their nameplate generation capacity, and their pollution emissions (NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, PM<sub>2.5</sub>)
- Incidence rates of several types of cancers for each county in the US
- Incidence rates of various lung and cardiovascular diseases for each county in the US
- Life expectancy data for every country
- GDP per capita data for every country
- Healthcare spending per capita for every country
- Poverty rates for every country
- Obesity rates for every country
- Smoking rates for every country
- Pollution levels / air quality indices in every country
